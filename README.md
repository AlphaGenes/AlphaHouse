Alphahouse contains most of the multipurpose functions required for alphasuite software.

It contains two folders, 


BioComputational - for procedures and functionality that is tied to biology
Utilities - for procedures that aren't tied to biology in any way


It is our endeavour to unit test most of the functionality in alpha house.
